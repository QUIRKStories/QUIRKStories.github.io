                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Before the Veil and the creation of skill based magic, there was Primal Magic. This ancient form of magic drew its power from the natural world. Each primal magic force is maintained by a Dragon Avatar. Whether the avatars are the source or result of primal magic, is a hotly debated philosophical topic. These immortal beings each exist in their own pocket dimensions and are the embodiments of their respective forces. They cannot be physically attacked and they cannot manifest in the Material World directly without some sort of extreme extenuating circumstances. They are able to communicate directly with creatures who perform ancient rituals to summon them, and can whisper into the dreams and thoughts of most sentient creatures. Their motives are ineffable.&nbsp;<br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Shamen gain their powers by attuning themselves with one of the six primal Avatars. This is accomplished during a practice called a Vision Quest, where the Shaman will enter a trance through the use of psychedelic ritual. The Shaman will commune with one of the Primal Avatars and will forge a pact with it. This is the first of 5 potential Vision Quests a Shaman may go on in their lives.
<br>
<br>Unlike normal skill points, Primal Attunement doesn't level up with the advancement track. A Shaman can only attempt the next level of a Vision Quest when they are ready. This can take years of practice and communing with their primal avatar. Work with the Weaver to decide when your character will be ready to attempt the next level of a vision quest and to pace your advancement with the story.
<br>
<br>Each Vision Quest, except the first, which you get for free as part of your character creation, will have a requirement you will have to complete. This may be a rare object you must locate, or a challenging trial you must overcome. It should be a sub-quest level activity. Work with the Weaver to come up with an objective that fits the themes of the story and the Primal you serve.
<br>
<br>Every pact has things the shaman is forsworn from doing and things they are obligated to do. If they break this covenant with the Primal they lose all of their powers until they have atoned. The higher their level, the more they will have to do to redeem themselves. At level 1, this should be a downtime action. At level 5 this should be a full quest level activity. Work with the Weaver to figure out what your character has to do should they become cut off from their Primal.&nbsp;<br></p>

If the character is knowingly telling you a lie, the weaver will tell you so. If the character believes what they are saying to be true, or if they are lying by omission, it will read as true.

                    <h6 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mt-0 mb-4 display-7">Warlocks harness the primal force within magical creatures' bodies, blood, life force, and even souls. Using dark rituals to empower themselves and cast spells. A Warlock may be inducted by others, find a source of lost knowledge, or be tempted to power by outside influence. One way or another, a person accepts Dark Knowledge being offered to them. It lifts the Veil from the Warlock and gives them the ability to use “Black Tongue”, a casting language of dark and forbidden words of power. <br><br>Once Dark Knowledge is inside a person, it is part of their pattern. Dark Magic spells are a powerful shortcut to spellcasting, but their use taints those who use them. Those who come to rely on them become addicted to their use. The more they know, the more they are compelled to use their power.</h6>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Warlocks are able to copy the effect of almost any spell effect that other casters can accomplish. Warlock spells are the products of expensive and often dangerous research and experimentation, as such, most of them treat theirs as guarded secrets. Every Warlock spell starts with the effect they are trying to replicate. Let's say they wanted to cast a copy of Pyrokinesis from Metaphysics. The more powerful the spell effect they are trying to accomplish, the rarer and harder to come by the creature component for the spell will be. They might get their hands on Phoenix feathers, Lava Snail shells, or some other relatively rare fire attuned creature part. The Weaver can help figure out a viable component. They would  then find the right words in Black Tongue to say, and the right body movements to make. Once they have figured it all out, they can add it to their Known Spells list. Provided they have the material they need to sacrifice, and they aren’t bound or gagged, A Warlock can cast any spell they know as an action. They make a Spirit Roll, and the effect of the roll mirrors the original spell copied. 
<br>
<br>Warlocks can also use Dark Magic to engage in the practice of creating Macabre Husks. These are often used to guard their secrets or to perform mundane repetitive labour the Warlock does not want to do themselves. The process of creating Macabre Husks is unique to each Warlock, but it always involves the construction of a vessel, usually out of stolen body parts, and a dark ritual to implant an animating force into the husk. Macabre Husks are usually bound to the service of their creator, but mistakes and accidents can happen during the creation, leaving them uncontrollable.&nbsp;<br></p>
