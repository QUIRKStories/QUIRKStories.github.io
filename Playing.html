                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">So you’re all scheduled, everyone has a character ready and you’re ready to start playing. You all show up for the first session and… now what?
<br>
<br>First thing you should do is plan for 10-15 minutes of socialization at the top of the game. Giving people the opportunity to chat helps them get all the “out of character” energy out at the top of the game, lets them catch up on real life, and gets everyone comfortable and loosened up for social interaction. It also helps by providing a buffer of time in case one or more of the players is running late.
<br>
<br>Now that it's time to get started, the next thing to do is to ask everyone to summarize the events of the last session. Even though you kept your own notes, it’s better to have the other players do the recap for two reasons. First it helps get everyone engaged, and second it lets you know if there are any important details they forgot to mention, you can bring them up at the end of the recap. If this is your very first game you can replace this recap with a summarization of the setting and group dynamic and move to the next step.
<br>
<br>Have each player set their character challenge for the session.
<br>
<br>If the characters have had off screen time in between the last session and this one you may want to resolve downtime actions. Ask each player what their character has been up to in the time. If they are doing activities that require a roll to be made, they can do so now. Downtime can be used for things like furthering personal stories, going shopping for equipment or resources, or performing labor and crafting tasks.&nbsp;<br></p>

				<h5 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style align-center mb-0 mt-4 display-7">There are 2 general ends of a spectrum when it comes to handling player interaction with your NPCs. Neither of them is the “right way” to play or inherently better than the other. They both have pros and cons, and you’ll need to find the method that works for you. <br><br>Most players eventually settle somewhere in between the two, with major plot interactions being done in interactive dialogue and the rest of the encounters being through conveying intent.</h5>

						<h5 class="card-title mbr-fonts-style display-5"><strong>Interactive Dialogue</strong></h5>
						<p class="card-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">
							Each NPC has a distinct character voice and behavior, and the players have to directly roleplay their interactions with them using in-character dialogue. This method is arguably the harder of the two. It requires acting skills, quick improv, and the dedication to remain in character. But it also rewards you with the deepest level of immersion in the game world.

						<h5 class="card-title mbr-fonts-style display-5"><strong>Convey Intent</strong></h5>
						<p class="card-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">
							You describe the NPCs and their character voices, and provide a summary of their intent when they communicate, rather than use line by line dialogue. Players also respond in kind. This is the easier of the two. It lets the character do the talking instead of the player having to improv lines. But it adds a layer of separation, and is less immersive overall.

                  Having a “voice” for your character helps distinguish when you are talking as a player, and when you are talking as a character. You don’t need a thick accent or distracting mannerism, just making a small adjustment to your normal speaking voice can be enough.

                  Your ability to engage with the game will be vastly improved with note-taking. Keeping track of; NPC names and personality traits, details about locations or events, and information about your quandary, enriches your ability to enjoy the game. You don’t have to write whole paragraphs, even just bullet points will make a huge difference.

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">
                  The more you ask about the world around your character, the better your chance of success will be. Try to figure out how things work, question the motives and motivations of NPCs, and be mindful of the ripple effects of your actions. Remember to use all your characters senses. Use the Investigate and Assess moves whenever you can. Don’t be afraid to ask clarifying questions if you are confused or need more detail.

                  Don’t expect to play in a vacuum. This is a social, collaborative game, which makes it important for the players to find opportunities to cooperate wherever possible. When faced with a challenge, you don’t only have your own tools, you have those of your whole group. Discuss the challenge before acting, preferably in character whenever possible. Decide as a group what you are all going to do.

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">This is a positive-sum game. The more fun each player is having, the more fun everyone at the table is having. You should look for chances to shine the spotlight on every player at the table. It can be tempting to solve every challenge your party faces yourself, we all like to be the hero. However, instead, consider if your character can point out opportunities for other characters to show off their skills, share their backstory, or achieve an objective. Not only does this keep everyone involved, but opens up roleplay opportunities.&nbsp;<br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">A part of learning to thrive at roleplaying games is to practice the skill of radical acceptance. To learn to embrace unexpected or unfavorable outcomes to your actions. 
<br>
<br>Remember that part of the excitement is not knowing exactly what is going to happen. You may make a perfect plan, only to feel like the dice deny you at every turn, and it's ok to get frustrated, chance is sometimes cruel. But if everything always went exactly as we wanted it to, it wouldn’t be a game. The failures are opportunities to laugh as a group, to learn new strategies, and to gain experience points.&nbsp;<br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">It’s important to remember that Weaver is not out to defeat or trick the other players. So when a new story hook pops up in the campaign, you should trust that it is a real adventure, not a trap. That the Weaver has put real time and effort into preparing it, and has done their best to make sure the story it leads fits the players’ interests. And then you should bite the hook.
<br>
<br>That isn’t to say that you should refrain from developing creative solutions to the hooks. Or not talk to the Weaver outside of the game with critical feedback if there’s something you’re not enjoying. But in almost all cases, Weavers work hard to create fun experiences for everyone, and simply ignoring the story hooks they provide only hurts the game.&nbsp;<br></p>

                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-3 display-5"><strong>Invest in the World</strong></h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">After investing all that time, effort, and passion into building a character, it’s not uncommon for players to only really focus on their character sheet, mostly ignoring the world the campaign takes place in. Many RPG campaigns face a disconnect between the world of the game and the played experience of the players around the table. Especially if your experience comes from a top down system that has less player agency. 
<br>
<br>The Weaver may create the bulk of the game world after session zero. But Threads can create things too. Work with the Weaver to create locations, NPCs, or historical events that your character might be tied to. Collaborate to build real, meaningful relationships so that they may appear as hooks in the campaign. 
<br>
<br>By grounding your character with connections in the world, you can enrich your own gameplay experience, making the game a place for your character to act in, rather than a mere stage dressing for them to stand in front of.&nbsp;<br></p>
