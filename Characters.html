					<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7">
						Farnsly is an older, slovenly man of indeterminate age, though likely in his late 50s or early 60s, who appears to be perpetually disheveled and unkempt. He has a stocky build and carries himself with a slight slouch. His face is jowly and often unshaven, and his hair is thinning and greasy, often plastered to his head in a haphazard fashion. He has a constant, lecherous leer and his eyes seem to be always darting around, looking for an opportunity to slack off or make inappropriate comments. His suit is always wrinkled and stained, and he seems to have a permanent layer of grime clinging to him. He often has food crumbs on his clothes and a lingering smell of stale coffee and cigars. He also seems to have a collection of odd-looking stains that defy explanation.

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Diana is a strong willed and driven individual. She is exceptionally intelligent and a proficient manipulator. Diana displays sociopathic tendencies, but fails to meet the clinical definition for the disorder. She is calculating, will use others as human shields, and only cares for collateral damage in so much as it affects her.<br></p>

                  <strong>Background:</strong>
                </h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Diana Waller was born to Mark and Irene Waller (this information has no primary sources, neither of these people appear in any official registry) in California, while living in a traveling hippy commune. (again this information has no primary source) No official record of her existence prior to 1995 could be found. Her DOB is estimated based on medical information.
<br>
<br>On the 13th of Dec, 1995. A pair of hikers, while traveling the Six Rivers National Forest, came across the burned out remains of 2 camper vans, along with a  hypothermic and unconscious 10 year Diana, and the eviscerated and dismembered remains of what would later be determined to have been 12 individuals, 8 of which bore non-human blood markers. (Cross contamination and limited technology at the time made DNA identification impossible and samples were not preserved.)
<br>
<br>Diana was in a state of deep shock and was found covered in blood and with superficial wounds. She was borderline catatonic for 46 days following her discovery. She was found to be entirely well again on the morning of the 47th day of observation, having made a full recovery seemingly overnight. The Lyptenwitz Test was administered and it was confirmed that she was Veil Broken. Lighthouse Psycognition specialists were brought in and it was also determined that Diana possesses an innate immunity to mental probing and manipulation. Diana has created a mental block around the event and her past, and has total retrograde amnesia covering her personal history prior to waking up in the hospital. 
<br>
<br>Diana was placed with the KinderCare Orphan program. Over the next 5 years she would go on to have over 50 interactions with the DVC and 6 different foster families. Behavioral issues, particularly a seemingly compulsive trend towards conflict escalation and violent outbursts were ongoing.
<br>
<br>At 15 she was assessed as a prime candidate and transferred to the [REDACTED] (See File B407C29ZY563AX1)
<br>
<br>Following the closure of the [REDACTED] in 2001, she caused the collision and roll over of the transport bus that was moving her and 19 other former participants. She then escaped into the wilderness, and following an unsuccessful manhunt, she fell off the radar. 
<br>
<br>Diana re-appears 10 years later in 2011, having usurped control of a South American drug cartel. She then made a number of successful power moves over the next 6 years, claiming and consolidating power in the region and amassing a sizable personal fortune. Then in 2017 she abruptly disappeared from the radar again, leaving a power vacuum in the cartel that led to the events of "El Día de la Sangre y la Muerte" (See File BA410579CYX6Z28)
<br>
<br>Diana re-appears in 2019, now accompanied by her right hand man, Finnigan O'Leary. (See File 3B2056Y41CZA8X7) Posing as art and antiquity dealers, they acquired a number of enchanted items and extradimensional relics from private collections in a spree of purchases and thefts. The total number of deals made during this 6 month period are unknown. The location of the objects is unknown. It is believed she is using an extra-dimensional storage of some kind.
<br>Following the rash of acquisitions, Diana once again disappeared.
<br>
<br>Following the events of COVID, Diana emerged once again in 2022, this time running a Contractor Agency registered out of a front office in New York City, which as of 2025 continues to operate and recruit new members. C.L.O.V.E.R advertises itself as a specialist problem resolution and consulting organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>

                  <strong>Motivations:</strong></h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Due to her immunity to Psycognition, Diana's motivations remain enigmatic. But personal wealth and the acquisition of power have consistently been observed to fuel her actions.<br></p>

                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-3 display-5"><strong>Tactical Assessment:</strong></h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Diana is an extremely high threat individual. Her physical limits well surpass the normal boundaries of human ability and she is abnormally resistant to damage. While proficient in hand to hand combat, Diana is much more likely to use firearms. Due to her Red Room training, she is extremely proficient in the use of all types of ranged weapon, and her accuracy is supernaturally enhanced by her own innate ability.
<br>
<br>Diana is a tactical genius, and by far her most dangerous asset is her ability to out-maneuver her opponents. She is able to adapt almost instantly to changing circumstances and can predict the actions of others with high levels of accuracy.</p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Finnigan is a quiet man, softspoken and of few words. He appears to often get lost in thought when others are talking. He is fastidious in his work and passionate about the inner workings of machines. Psycognition has limited effect on him, most likely due to his Fae nature, or potentially his proximity and extended interaction with Diana Waller. He is consistently calm under pressure and has a strong attention to detail. He is not inclined to use violence as a primary solution.&nbsp;<br></p>

                </h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Finnigan (true name unknown) is an unregistered Fae being, from an unknown part of the Neighbors (See File 0ZX8Y712A495BC3)
<br>
<br>His whereabouts and activities prior to 2019 are unknown.
<br>
<br>In 2019 he appeared alongside Diana Waller. (See File 8034961CXAY275B) Posing as art and antiquity dealers, they acquired a number of enchanted items and extradimensional relics from private collections in a spree of purchases and thefts. The total number of deals made during this 6 month period are unknown. The location of the objects is unknown. It is believed they are using an extra-dimensional storage of some kind. Following the rash of acquisitions, Finnigan disappeared alongside Diana.
<br>
<br>Since its formation in 2022, Finnigan has been the Mercenary Liaison for C.L.O.V.E.R working directly under Diana Waller. His duties include the oversight of mercenary teams, as well as the completion of personal tasks for Diana.<br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Physically he is considered a low threat individual; possessing less strength and stamina than the average human male, and not being trained in any form of hand to hand combat or advanced marksmanship. However, his evasiveness and unique abilities makes him extremely dangerous in a direct conflict. 
<br>
<br>His speed exceeds the limits of human perception and he is able to unconsciously dodge attacks. 
<br>
<br>His ability to manipulate Luck prevents the use of surprise or guerrilla tactics against him. In addition he is able to teleport instantly, using an unknown Fae magic.&nbsp;<br></p>
